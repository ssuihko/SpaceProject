### Space Notebook Project

This is a personal project for keeping track of for-fun studies of space and SciFi, mostly focused on different kinds of existing real and fictional spacecrafts.

At the end of the project 
1. user can login and logout of the application
2. a database of notebook items is being upheld - first in elephantSQL, but to be migrated to docker, due to the end-of-life of the db service.
3. User should be able to connect ideas together in a node-map like structure (frontend functionality).
